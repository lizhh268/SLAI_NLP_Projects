Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Brilliant Metaphors of Xi Jinping about Comprehensively Strengthening Party Discipline
During the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech on January 11, emphasizing that “we should keep marching ahead on the road of adhering to the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline and creating a new situation for comprehensively strengthening party discipline”.
With respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline, General Secretary Xi Jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaphors, so lets review them together!
We should fight against “tigers” (high-ranking corrupt officials) immediately after we find evidence, and we should also deal with those “flies” (low-ranking corrupt officials) at the same time. We should spread the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline to grass-roots party organizations and make every effort to deal with those corruption problems in daily life of the general public.
-- On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech during the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China
Officials responsible for discipline inspection and supervision at all levels should be loyal and determined, responsible, discipline and law-abiding, honest and upright in order to ensure that the power granted by the Party and the people will not be abused, and the sharp sword used for praising virtue and punishing vice will never be covered by dust.

-- During December 25 and 26, 2017, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech at the meeting of democratic life held by Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC
Our comrades from the Political Bureau should learn about history and be reasonable and must not confuse public and private interests, call white black, blur the boundary between righteousness and benefits or handle issues based on nepotism. You should erect a “wind vane” by taking the lead in adhering to honesty and self-discipline and help establish a work style for the party characterized by honesty and integrity.

In addition, they should also make efforts to eliminate vice and exalt virtue, strengthen resistance against corruption and eliminate evil factors, perform their duties in creating an honest and upright political ecology and make their contributions during the process.
-- On March 8, 2017, Xi Jinping emphasized the following during review of the Sichuan Delegation at the 5th session of the 12th National People's Congress

Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.

This made Aunt Gao and her family, residents of the Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road in Nanning, very happy.
Neighbors also said that flowers blooming on the money tree is a rare sight. Residents of the housing estate felt that this was very auspicious, and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter.
The scientific name for the money tree is “Malabar Chestnut”, a tropical plant native to Mexico. It performs best in warm and damp conditions, and its flowers will only bloom under appropriate conditions such as sunlight, water and nutriments.
Even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowers blooming on money trees are rare. It was once said that the “chance of flowers blooming is one in a thousand”.
Yesterday morning, reporters visited the Nanning Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road. Led by Aunt Gao, the reporters saw the money tree.
Planted amid the flower bed of the housing estate, the money tree was about five meters tall, and the branch circumference, at its thickest, measured approximately 30 cm. Its leaves were emerald green and luxuriant.
The flowers bloomed at tips of higher branches, and the flowers that were in full bloom were more than 10 cm wide. The delicate pale yellow filaments were evenly spread out, and the green buds, when burst, curled backwards on both sides. The fine and dense stamens resembled silver threads with gold stars at their tips.
Aunt Gao told the reporters that the money tree has been planted for eight years. When it was first planted, it was about one meter tall; it is now more than five meters tall.
It was originally a potted plant when her son first bought it from the flower and bird market, and was subsequently planted in the flower bed. She did not have to take particular care of it, but would occasionally earth it up.

Shichang Xingbao reported that between 2005 and 2011, the GDP of Anhui Province rose from joint “bottom” to second at one stroke.
However, the Provinces economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency, and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the “Economic Blue Paper” of the Provinces Economic Information Center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth.
We have made a comparison of some of the representative indices of the Provinces economy between 2005 and 2011 with that of the nation and Central China.
In 2011, in terms of industrial economic benefit, high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which comprised a relatively large proportion of the Province, had to endure “twin pressures” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity. At the same time, home appliances, automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits.
Meanwhile, enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit, which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth.
As regards this, experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incentivize enterprises to innovate. The technical outcomes of Institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “transferred” to enterprises.
As for low industrial economic benefit, experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced, industry structure optimized, and the industry chain extended.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
China News Service Tibet, May 11 wire (Chen Taobin) Nyima Tsering, Deputy Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau said at the Everest North Base Camp on the 10th that the cleaning up of domestic waste on the northern slope of Mount Everest will move from a public interest action in the past toward a normalized action led by the Chinese government and in which the international community will participate.
On May 10, environmental protection volunteers loaded rubbish that have been sorted onto trucks.
China News Service/He Penglei: In the last 10 years or so, environmental protection issues at Mount Everest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Mount Everest explorers and tourists increased significantly.
In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association initiated the first clean-up on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up oxygen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This video was also specially broadcast at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year, drawing world attention.
According to Nyima Tsering, after 1997, public interest groups arrived successively to help clean up the Northern slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
By staff reporter Wang Yichen: The International Conference on Renewable Energy Development and Technology jointly organized by State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and the International Electrotechnical Commission was held in Frankfurt, Germany recently.
At present, accelerating the development of renewable energy, and advancing transformation toward clean and low-carbon energy have become a global trend.
However, large-scale development and use of renewable energy continued to be assailed by system security, long-distance delivery, technology economic and other issues and challenges that need to be confronted and resolved.
SGCC Chairman Shu Yinbiao revealed that the company was in the process of planning to expand the size of the synchronous power grid so as to strengthen the existing regional power grid interconnection. By 2020, inter-regional power transmission capacity will increase to about 300 million kW.
