Last week, the broadcast of period drama “Beauty Private Kitchen” was temporarily halted, and accidentally triggered heated debate about faked ratings of locally produced dramas.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last years total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that in October, prices of new and second-hand residential properties cooled, up 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month, respectively.

BBC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like “living in a new age”
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old.
The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.
According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City.
Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing." He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”
According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."
According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service.
Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food plays a central role in Chinas many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners.
Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Years eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”
According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture.
Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.
Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyones busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.
According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years.
Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.
Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."
The report believed that the hindrance to growth in human capital as a result of aging has become increasingly apparent. This was particularly the case in the Northeast, where the annual average contribution of aging to human capital growth was -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng said that the present of risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled. The fundamental factors underpinning international balance of payments will still exist over the longer term.
China News Service Beijing December 17 wire (Reporter: Gao Kai) Heritage makes the world resplendent - The opening ceremony of the 2016 International Summit for the Authentication, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Calligraphy and Painting was held at Renmin University of China on December 17.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of coercing mobile phone manufacturers into installing software such as the Google search engine and Chrome web browser, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission believed that this harmed consumer interests and hindered competition.
EU regulators initially requested that Google make a response prior to July 27.
If found guilty of violating antitrust rules, Google could face a maximum fine of 10% of its global turnover, or approximately US$7.4 billion.
Google has not made immediate comment on this.
Google also faced EU investigations over giving prominent placement to its own shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay-abroad is a real one. It can be said that his achievement of “jumping level” from the national youth to the national Olympics is by no means accidental, and his leap-forward growth is still surprising.
Understand through a picture: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large.
*This article is taken from Wallstreetcn (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more exciting information, visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wallstreetcn APP. *
As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.
A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.
(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.
From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).
This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.
The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.
Although Bitcoins popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.
Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.
Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.
The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.
Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.
According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.
As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."

Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.
Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency.
In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit.
After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”.
In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelors degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate.
In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents.
Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies.
Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, with car parking charged at £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Zou Shoumin, Director of the Bureau of Environmental Supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on the 22nd in Beijing that on a nationwide basis, 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines. The newly amended “Environmental Protection Law”, implemented at the beginning of this year, has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China.
Presently, the environmental protection bureaus across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines, close down operations and/or distrain, limit or suspend production, and persons held under administrative detention. They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.
Zou Shoumin said that in August, a total of 335 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and/or distrain; 177 cases pertained to limiting or suspension of production; 189 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention; and 166 cases pertained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes.
In particular, Henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases. At present, China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process, intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-round basis.
Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged, Chinas Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth, and increase “green determination”. The more economic growth decelerates, the more it should hold fast to environmental protection, and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy.
Theres no peak, only higher. The share price of Kweichow Moutai has continued to set new highs unabated.
On January 9, A-share “champion” Kweichow Moutai set another new record high, closing at RMB782.52 for the day. Total market capitalization amounted to RMB983 billion, just a stones throw from the RMB1 trillion market capitalization mark.
The guidance price of RMB1,499 was RMB200 higher than the previous retail price of RMB1,299.
On December 28, Kweichow Moutai announced that upon study, it has decided to appropriately hike the price of Moutai liquor products in 2018; on average, the magnitude of the hike would be approximately 18%.
This price hike caused Kweichow Moutai shares to soar. A Beijing Morning Post reporter calculated and found that Kweichow Moutais share price had increased by RMB95, or more than 14%, over the eight trading days since the company announced its price hike.
Data showed that the aggregate output value of Guizhou Province for the first to the third quarters of 2017 amounted to RMB950 billion. Maotais market capitalization far outstripped Guizhou Provinces GDP for the first three quarters.
Driven by Moutai, listed baijiu companies began to introduce price hikes and control supply, enjoying the dividend brought about by consumption upgrading.
2017 year-to-date, the share prices of most listed baijiu companies have continued to soar. In particular, the share prices of Swellfun, Wuliangye Yibin, Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine, and Kweichow Maotai have at least doubled

High-level foreign talent with Chinese green cards who found technology enterprises may enjoy “citizen treatment”.
The first of the “20 measures to further open up and actively utilize foreign investment” states that China would “support high-level foreign talent who hold permanent residence permits found technology related enterprises”.
